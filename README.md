# 📊 Power BI Projects — Data Transformation, Modeling & Visualization
# 🧾 Overview

This repository contains two Power BI projects that demonstrate end-to-end data analytics processes — from data cleaning and transformation to data modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization.
These assignments showcase proficiency in Power Query, DAX functions, and interactive dashboard design for business analysis and decision-making.

# 🧩 Assignment 1: Data Transformation & Data Modeling
# 🔹 Objective

To prepare and model raw business data for analysis by performing data transformation, merging, and relationship management within Power BI.

# 🔹 Steps Involved

Get Data

# Imported datasets including:

Order Data

Order Details

Sales Target

# Transform Data (Power Query Editor)

Cleaned and reshaped raw data.

Performed merging of City & State fields to create combined location data.

# Created a Profit Margin column categorized as:

Loss

Break-Even

Profit

# Data Merging and Filtering

Combined datasets to ensure complete order-level insights.

Applied sorting and filtering for better data organization.

# Grouping & Aggregation

Grouped data by month to calculate Sales Target and Total Amount of Target Achieved.

# Data Modeling

Established relationships between tables (e.g., Orders ↔ Order Details ↔ Sales Targets).

Designed a star schema for efficient data analysis.

# 🔹 Key Outcomes

Clean and relational data model ready for dashboarding.

Improved data consistency and accuracy.

Foundation for DAX-based calculations in subsequent analysis.

# 📈 Assignment 2: DAX, Data Analysis & Visualization

# 🔹 Objective

To create calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and build interactive Power BI visualizations.

# 🔹 Key Components

# Calculated Columns

Derived new columns for metrics such as:

Profit calculations

Sales growth percentage

Target achievement ratios

# DAX Measures

Created key measures to support data visualization:

Total Sales

Average Profit

Total Quantity

Performance KPIs against targets

# Relationships

Maintained relationships among multiple data tables for accurate aggregation and cross-filtering.

# Data Visualization

# Developed dashboards featuring:

Monthly sales trend charts

Target vs Actual visual comparison

Profitability analysis by region and product

KPIs and cards for key business metrics

# 🔹 Key Outcomes

Enhanced analytical depth through DAX formulas.

Fully interactive Power BI dashboard.

Visual insights that aid decision-making and performance tracking.

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI Desktop

Power Query Editor

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

Data Modeling & Relationships

Visualization Tools (Charts, Cards, KPIs, Filters)

# 🧠 Insights & Learnings

Demonstrated complete Power BI workflow — from data extraction to visualization.

Showcased ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes for business data.

Built a dynamic model to analyze sales performance, profit margins, and target achievements.

Strengthened skills in data modeling, DAX formulation, and business storytelling.

# 💡 Business Impact

These Power BI projects demonstrate how raw business data can be transformed into meaningful insights using Power Query, DAX, and visualization.

They serve as templates for sales tracking, performance monitoring, and KPI-based reporting in real-world business scenarios.
